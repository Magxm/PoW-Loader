## Technical Details

### Building the Mod

To build the mod yourself:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Magxm/PoW-Loader
    ```

2. Open the solution file and compile. A ready-to-use build will be located in `Output/Mod`.


### Translation and Update Automation

To get the latest translations or update the translation sheet to match the current game version, use the `PoW_Tool_SheetUtils` tool, which automates these tasks. 

> **Requirements**:
> - Access to the translation sheets
> - A configured Google Cloud account

### Mod Loader and Plugins

This repository leverages **BepInEx** as the underlying mod loader and includes a `ModAPI` plugin offering core functionality for other mods and plugins. Key features include:

- **Dynamic Asset Overrides**: Support for multiple external asset folders, enabling several mods to register asset overrides.
- **Prefab Texture Modification**: Ability to modify textures within game prefabs.

Additionally, the `EnglishPatch` plugin is included to support English translations. Place translated asset files into the `Mods/EnglishTranslate` folder, and the plugin will handle loading these resources and resolve display issues.

### Important Configuration Note for BepInEx

When updating or replacing BepInEx, ensure you update the `BepInEx.cfg` file and replace the `[Preloader.Entrypoint]` section as follows:

```ini
[Preloader.Entrypoint]

## The local filename of the assembly to target.
# Setting type: String
# Default value: UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll
Assembly = UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll

## The name of the type in the entrypoint assembly to search for the entrypoint method.
# Setting type: String
# Default value: Application
Type = Object

## The name of the method in the specified entrypoint assembly and type to hook and load Chainloader from.
# Setting type: String
# Default value: .cctor
Method = .cctor
```

This adjustment ensures the entrypoint is set correctly, allowing all necessary assets to load before the game fully starts.

The Dependencies folder contains components from the games, Unity assemblies and compiled BepInEx and Harmony binaries required for plugins. All rights to these files belong to their respective copyright holders.
I am aware that we should have contributor provide these files locally, however I am honestly too lazy to change this
