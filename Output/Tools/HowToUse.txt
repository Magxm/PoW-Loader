1. Start the GUI version.
2. Drag and drop the needed assetbundles from the AssetBundle folder into the application. (config is enough for text assets)
3. Press Export.
4. Select a destination folder
5. After it finishes copy the CombineExportedAssetBundlesFolder.bat to the destinationFolder/config/Assets. (config might be another string if you imported more assets than just config)
6. Run the .bat
7. An accurate representation of the folder structure needed for mods will be found in AssetBundle_combined including all files that can be loaded over the ExternalResourceProvider

One might need to rename file extensions. File names and folder names should be accurate.
