ending0001_f line Text01	Looking at the barely visible Pavilion in the mountains,
ending0001_f line Text02	You fiddle with the emblem in your hand, unsure of how you feel.
ending0001_f line Text03	Is it hubris? Is it cowardice? You begin to hesitate.
ending0001_f line Text04	You toss the emblem that anyone else would desire into the brush on the side of the road
ending0001_f line Text05	and decide to walk away.

ending0001_f line Text06_1	
ending0001_f line Text07	You've decided that instead of wielding a weapon, you'd rather wield a tool.
ending0001_f line Text08	Waking up and working, providing for food and shelter, that is the real path to happiness.
ending0001_f line Text09	As for the years after, the conflict in wulin

ending0002_f title	Better off leaving
ending0002_f line Text01	Against the fierce attacks, you were unable to get up again and pass out.
ending0002_f line Text02	At that point, you realize, before real power, how weak you are.
ending0002_f line Text03	Days later, you awaken in your room.
ending0002_f line Text04	Is this feeling frustration or confusion? It doesn't matter, you hesitate.

ending0003_f line Text01	The failures in the exam ended your opportunity to keep learning in the Pavilion.
ending0003_f line Text02	You return the Emblem to Mu Renxin. He lets out a cold "Hmph" and doesn't look at you once.
ending0003_f line Text03	Later, you bid farewell to your friends and start on your path home.
ending0003_f line Text04	On the slow moving boat you look at the Pavilion.
ending0003_f line Text05	You're not satisified.
ending0003_f line Text06	Why weren't you the one to pass the exam? Is your talent worse than the others?
ending0003_f line Text07	After some time, discontent with fate, you start on the path of no return.
ending0003_f line Text08	"Walking the path of Xia" is nothing but a joke.
ending0003_f line Text09	You start to abuse the skills you've learned in the Pavilion and commit crimes.
ending0003_f line Text10	You form a group with other students who also failed.
ending0003_f line Text11	Years later, you run into your old classmates who have been succesful.
ending0003_f line Text12	They didn't come to reminicse about the past, but to follow the Master's orders to stop you.

ending0005_f line Text03	These doubts fall away at the last moment of your life.
ending0005_f line Text04	The one to walk to the end doesn't have to be yourself.
ending0005_f line Text05	Turning into dust, you make the path more solid, for those that come after.

ending0006_f line Text02	in this fight for survival, no one held back.
ending0006_f line Text03	You see a weapon flash before you, a cool touch to your chest, then pain. You fall powerless to your knees.

ending0007_f line Text01	Automatons laid siege to the Pavilion, corpse zombies are all over the mountain,
ending0007_f line Text02	that Abyssal Palace leader, like a wraith, left only severed limbs and arms behind.
ending0007_f line Text03	Facing the inhuman monster by her side, even the battle-tested Masters could only fall victim to its blade.

ending0007_f line Text05	In your fading mind, you can only see the Abyssal Palace leader's face, cold as ice,
ending0007_f line Text06	and Ling Wujue's pale ash-like face behind the white veil.
ending0007_f line Text07	They chat, lightly, but all you can hear are the roar and screams from your peers, mixed with corpse zombies' wild evil laughter.
ending0007_f line Text08	There are only hatred and madness in this destined battlefield.

ending0008_f title	A dream in the Pavilion
ending0008_f line Text01	The days you spend studying in the Xia Pavilion faded like a pipe dream.
ending0008_f line Text02	After you were escorted to the capital, the Embroidered Guard locked your group into the royal prison and interrogated you for days and nights,
ending0008_f line Text03	but none were willing to confess to the false crime of human trafficking.
ending0008_f line Text04	As the time goes on, under the delusion of the Craft Queen, the Emperor considered removing the Xia Pavilion and the Sky Stealer Fort all together.
ending0008_f line Text05	With all lives hanging by a thread, Chu Tianabi confessed to the charges, took all the responsibility,
ending0008_f line Text06	and traded his own life in exchange for mercy, and for everyone who lived in the Pavilion.
ending0008_f line Text07	The Xia Pavilion and the Sky Stealer Fort were dissolved under the imperial order. You, as well as the imprisoned Masters and peers
ending0008_f line Text08	were all disarmed and maimed, and exiled to remote provinces to serve your sentence in labor camps.
ending0008_f line Text09	However, the imperial court could not have forseen that the remnant of the Xia Pavilion, led by Duan Xiaolie, would rescue you in the following dozen years
ending0008_f line Text10	and organize the Heaven Rebellion with the Southern sects against the imperial court and Northern sects under their command, igniting the world in a rebellious flame.
ending0008_f line Text11	And this unrest that would soon shock the wulin, would add the first fuel to this sweeping flame...

ending0101_f line Text01	Duan Xiaolie and his disciple left the Xia Pavilion with blood and flame under their steps,
ending0101_f line Text02	just like the blood-stained, yet unwavering south mountain's bamboo.
ending0101_f line Text03	They claim they are justice, crusading on a short path filled with corpses and blood.
ending0101_f line Text04	We must stop this catastrophe veiled as justice that will soon be spread across the wulin.
ending0101_f line Text05	It might be fast to achieve peace, by stopping killing with killing, but that is definitely not a long-term solution.
ending0101_f line Text06	That is because in this world, there are only few absolute good and evil.
ending0101_f line Text07	Mostly, there are just conflicts of standpoints, based on desire and distrust amongst the people.
ending0101_f line Text08	If we can dissolve the standpoints, remove the estrangement, how many people would be unquestionably evil?
ending0101_f line Text09	Only by letting people open their hearts and understand eachother can the continuation of this hatred be truly ended.
ending0101_f line Text10	Lead the Wulin to become a peaceful world that treats people with kindness. 
ending0101_f line Text11	
ending0101_f line Text12	When  the dust settles, the work of rebuilding the Xia Pavilion begins.
ending0101_f line Text13	You can't help feeling sad, about the destruction of what you knew, but you raise your head,

ending0101_f line Text15	How can you stagnate here?
ending0101_f line Text16	You look at the gateway, it reminds you of when your comrade and Master left,
ending0101_f line Text17	those regretless silhouette, drenched in the blood-like scarlet, of the flame of combat and the setting sun...
ending0101_f line Text18	... Right, no matter how much you have lost, and what more you will need to face,

ending0201_m line Text08	there would still be a chest she can lean and cry on.
ending0201_m line Text09	Before leaving the Xia Pavilion you came to the purple cherry tree at the Flower Terrace,
ending0201_m line Text10	a thousand thoughts passing through your heart
ending0201_m line Text11	a pair of scarlet swallows flying beneath the crimson setting sun.
ending0201_m line Text12	No matter where the path beneath takes you,

ending0202_m title	Towards the Sunrise
ending0202_m line Text01	Since entering the Pavilion, all that she carried with her,
ending0202_m line Text02	was something intangible and unknowable.
ending0202_m line Text03	The decline of the Zhong family didn't happen overnight, nor it would have been easy to reverse by one person.
ending0202_m line Text04	Even at the start of your journey, with your ignorance of Jianghu, you knew there was a weight on her shoulders.
ending0202_m line Text05	The changes of wulin, the coming enemies, sorrows, and truths...
ending0202_m line Text06	All of of them struck her beliefs, ate at her spirit.

ending0202_m line Text10	"No, I'm not alone"
ending0202_m line Text11	When you speak what's in your heart, there was connection. You look into eachothers eyes and smile.
ending0202_m line Text12	Under the purple cherry tree, you lean on eachother, looking towards the infinite sea of flowers,
ending0202_m line Text13	no matter how difficult the road ahead is, or what challenges lay before you...
ending0202_m line Text14	You will walk together, supporting eachother,

ending0203_m line Text00	
ending0203_m line Text01	The scene of the welcoming banquet is still fresh in your mind, that smile, as welcoming as it was, you didn't think much more of it.
ending0203_m line Text02	But then, the winds of change came, you walked by her side,
ending0203_m line Text03	She became your shield, and you became her protector.
ending0203_m line Text04	You've seen her anger because you were poisoned, you've seen her pride when teaching.
ending0203_m line Text05	You've seen her guilt from killing, her frustration when she was confused.
ending0203_m line Text06	And only you've seen, when you said you would carry everything with her, her tearful and shy smile.
ending0203_m line Text07	You tie the wooden sword with thered tassel on her hip, on the Flower Terrace,
ending0203_m line Text08	You see their hair in the wind floating, as they turn and smile.
ending0203_m line Text09	The scar on their face, is proof of that decision. The sword, is the weightyou have to carry today onward.
ending0203_m line Text10	Even if infinite time was spent, if people demean and laugh about the gullibility and absurdity.

ending0204_m line Text03	at first, your paths only crossed because of fighting.
ending0204_m line Text04	Ambush, poison, and challenges kept coming, but neither of you gave up the other.
ending0204_m line Text05	Just like the path of Xia, there's sadness and sorrow, but you finally accepted her.
ending0204_m line Text06	Evil, has to be stopped at the beginning.
ending0204_m line Text07	Since then, no matter where on the battlefield,

ending0205_m line Text01	She is a Master, you were a student.
ending0205_m line Text02	...You thought, that was it.
ending0205_m line Text03	Until you slowly melted away her caution.
ending0205_m line Text04	Under that emotionless mask, that disciplined sword,
ending0205_m line Text05	is a tender heart.
ending0205_m line Text06	You, were her reason for taking off the mask.

ending0205_m line Text13	You gently take off the mask, and look into her eyes, asking
ending0205_m line Text14	"The road is long, would Master allow me to be your bodyguard?"
ending0205_m line Text15	A slight nod, the flowers floating in the wind reflect in your eyes, landing on her heart.

ending0206_f line Text10	"If I can put that down, we can start over now."
ending0206_f line Text11	You repeat this to yourself, under the purple cherry tree at the Flower Terrance.
ending0206_f line Text12	
ending0206_f line Text13	In the purple cherry petals dancing in the wind, and wide open scenery at the sunsetting Flower Terrance,
ending0206_f line Text14	He invited you to travel with him, to the remote, vast and beautiful places in the Jianghu,

ending0207_f line Text05	He keeps distance with you, because he doesn't want to lose the friendship he cherishes , again.
ending0207_f line Text06

ending0207_f line Text13	even though you can see the end of this path, but no one knew how long will it take...
ending0207_f line Text14	"Don't you regret?" You asked, lightly, and he only responded with a sneer,
ending0207_f line Text15	"I won't allow you to regret."
ending0207_f line Text16	You stop talking when you hear the response and stare into the distance.

ending0208_f line Text10	The unrest in the Jianghu never cease, yet neither should you forget,
ending0208_f line Text11	how people learn to know, to trust eachother through their barriers.
ending0208_f line Text12

ending0218_f line Text02	You are familiar with his silhouette
ending0218_f line Text03	No matter what dangers were ahead, he always protected you under his broad shadow.
ending0218_f line Text04	LIke a solid tree, sturdy stone, immovable, indestructible.
ending0218_f line Text05	...Or so you thought.
ending0218_f line Text06	It wasn't until it happened did you find out.
ending0218_f line Text07	His path of Xia is simple, but it is not easy at all.
ending0218_f line Text08	Protecting everyone in such chaotic times, what an extravagant dream.
ending0218_f line Text09	So you chose to step up, and show him something he's never seen.
ending0218_f line Text10	Maybe it's the difference between how you both do things or it's the same undercurrents.
ending0218_f line Text11	You promise that your goals are the same.
ending0218_f line Text12	You will use your own way, your own two hands to protect his beliefs.
ending0218_f line Text13	The rain and blades on the path before you
ending0218_f line Text14	You face fearlessly together because you both know,
ending0218_f line Text15	You are no longer being protected under the shadows, but you are eachother's light.
ending0301_m title	Hearts Apart
ending0301_m line Text01	Since you've first met in the Pavilion, fate has tied you together.
ending0301_m line Text02	Entering the Pavilion and passing the exams together,
ending0301_m line Text03	Experiencing all the world has to offer and the dangers of Jianghu.
ending0301_m line Text04	But she knows...imaginary dreams cannot save anyone
ending0301_m line Text05	Tossing away her past decisively and embracing a cruel decision.
ending0301_m line Text06	It was you that promised that you would carry everything with her.
ending0301_m line Text07	But your paths of Xia split, sending you to opposite ends of the world.
ending0301_m line Text08	Or maybe she left because she was afraid she couldn't sever the ties in her heart.
ending0301_m line Text09	A decision to escape that allows you both to walk your own paths.
ending0301_m line Text10	The distance between you, let her cherish the bond you had. She used it as medicine for her pains and hesitation.
ending0301_m line Text11	On that flower terrace, under the bright Cygnus constellation
ending0301_m line Text12	You also decided to find your own answers
ending0301_m line Text13	To not be afraid of the storm that covers the sun ahead,
ending0301_m line Text14	and wait patiently for the day you see her again in Jianghu.
ending0302_m title	Hearts Apart
ending0302_m line Text01	Since entering the Pavilion, all that she carried with her, was something intangible and unknowable.
ending0302_m line Text02	The decline of the Zhong family didn't happen overnight, nor it would have been easy to reverse by one person.
ending0302_m line Text03	Even at the start of your journey, with your ignorance of Jianghu, you knew there was a weight on her shoulders.
ending0302_m line Text04	The changes of wulin, the coming enemies, sorrows, and truths...
ending0302_m line Text05	All of of them struck her beliefs, ate at her spirit.
ending0302_m line Text06	Even so, you have never seen the spark in those eyes dim.
ending0302_m line Text07	Those this shoulders standing before the waves of the Sun Moon Villa.
ending0302_m line Text08	Their own strength, is it enough to hold up this sinking ship?
ending0302_m line Text09	"If that was you, you can definitely do it."
ending0302_m line Text10	On a lonely rock, you smiled,
ending0302_m line Text11	under a bright moon, rivers connect with the sky, just like the endless road ahead.
ending0302_m line Text12	Dispite this, you will not slow down...
ending0302_m line Text13	The long night will end, and the dawn must come.
ending0303_m title	Hearts Apart
ending0303_m line Text01	The scene of the welcoming banquet is still fresh in your mind, that smile, as welcoming as it was, you didn't think much more of it.
ending0303_m line Text02	But then, the winds of change came, you walked by her side. She became your shield, and you became her protector.
ending0303_m line Text03	You've seen her anger because you were poisoned, you've seen her pride when teaching.
ending0303_m line Text04	You've seen her guilt from killing, her frustration when she was confused.
ending0303_m line Text05	And only you've seen, when you said you would carry everything with her, her tearful and shy smile.
ending0303_m line Text06	That day, you decided to leave Mt. Lu with Masters and peers, seeking your own path.
ending0303_m line Text07	Before you leave, you looked at eachother, eye to eye, after some exchange of emotion, she smiled at you.
ending0303_m line Text08	And you understood in your heart.
ending0303_m line Text09	So you wear the wooden sword with red tassel by the waist, for now on, you will never forget about her, despite the distance apart.
ending0303_m line Text10	Desert sand is swept up towards the sky, and the world is vast, you do not know where she was, nor where she will go.
ending0303_m line Text11	The only thing you're sure of, is that when next time you meet, you both would be one step forward in your own path.
ending0304_m title	Hearts Apart
ending0304_m line Text01	Thinking about the past, bandits, assassins, zombies and Blood Wolves.
ending0304_m line Text02	Your path has been filled with conflicts since you've first met.
ending0304_m line Text03	Ambush, poison, one challenge after another, yet the two of you have never casted eachother aside.
ending0304_m line Text04	Yet your path together ended when her path of Xia diverged from yours.
ending0304_m line Text05	She believes,
ending0304_m line Text06	Evil, must be stopped at its infancy.
ending0304_m line Text07	You cannot be as absolute as she is.
ending0304_m line Text08	She did not think you were wrong, but she knows,
ending0304_m line Text09	the Jianghu is in chaos, a great enemy upon you, the two of you shouldn't walk your path together.
ending0304_m line Text10	Thus, she buried her feelings deep in her heart, as for those evil that accompanied her path,
ending0304_m line Text11	They shall be tribute for this memory.
ending0304_m line Text12	
ending0304_m line Text13	You looking upon the starry sky, each silver glow turns into a red spark in your eyes.
ending0304_m line Text14	Though you know not where she is now,
ending0304_m line Text15	you still hope that, once the world knows peace, that spark will burn before you once more.
ending0305_f title	Hearts Apart
ending0305_f line Text01	You first met on the shore of lake Panyang.
ending0305_f line Text02	He is also the first swordsman you've met in Jianghu.
ending0305_f line Text03	Obssessed with martial arts, addicted to alcohol, he is a Xia straight out of a wuxia novel.
ending0305_f line Text04	He is dashing, yet outgoing, and an inspiration to those around him,
ending0305_f line Text05	Only you know that there is a calm and gentle heart under his easygoing exterior.
ending0305_f line Text06	
ending0305_f line Text07	How can a swordsman that does not kill walk in Jianghu and uphold justice? He doesn't have an answer.
ending0305_f line Text08	All he can do is remind himself to keep walking this path of a benevolent Xia.
ending0305_f line Text09	Even if that path diverages from your beliefs.
ending0305_f line Text10	You have supported eachother and overcame all sorts of difficulties, for him, that is the most beautiful memory,
ending0305_f line Text11	That is also the only memory he can't let go.
ending0305_f line Text12	
ending0305_f line Text13	You look upon the star and the moon, one after another, pots of fine wine empties.
ending0305_f line Text14	You recall, once upon a time, the two of you had once drank under this starry sky, sparred under the falling petals.......
ending0305_f line Text15	「If I let go, we can start again.」
ending0305_f line Text16	You mumble to yourself, then smiles,「how can it be that easy?」
ending0305_f line Text17	But you also knew, you must keep walking down this path you called your own,
ending0305_f line Text18	so that you won't let him down, as he is on his own path.
ending0306_f title	Hearts Apart
ending0306_f line Text01	The natural difference in your physiques made him see you as challenge the moment you two met,
ending0306_f line Text02	yet he never seems to be able to get the upper hands in your competitions.
ending0306_f line Text03	Once you thought the two of you simply cannot get closer,
ending0306_f line Text04	Now, you truly and well understood that——
ending0306_f line Text05	He only kept distant from you because he doesn't want to lose the feelings he treasured again.
ending0306_f line Text06	
ending0306_f line Text07	The last few years, you have worked together and competed against eachother through many trials.
ending0306_f line Text08	Secretly, you hoped this friendly rivalry can go on forever.
ending0306_f line Text09	Yet your diveraging beliefs sitll drove the two of you on differing paths......
ending0306_f line Text10	You know, there will be a day when the two of you will reunite on the battlefield.
ending0306_f line Text11	Truly finding out who is stronger in defense of your own ideals.
ending0306_f line Text12	
ending0306_f line Text13	In the night, your dashing palm strike sends purple petals flying.
ending0306_f line Text14	Though you are fighting an imaginary opponent, you cannot help but recall,
ending0306_f line Text15	recall that familar move, that familar figure.......
ending0306_f line Text16	You stay your hand, and think about him, thinking that maybe he feels the same way as you do——
ending0306_f line Text17	No matter what was casted aside, the two of you have continue on your martial path without regret.
ending0306_f line Text18	The point is to not let him down......Not letting the rival that you will respect and cherish for life down.
ending0307_f title	Hearts Apart
ending0307_f line Text01	Along the way, he protected you, and you watched out for him.
ending0307_f line Text02	You believed that the two of you can face all the storms and rain together.
ending0307_f line Text03	Until the differing ideal of Xia made you step out from his back to walk a different path.
ending0307_f line Text04	Watching out for everyone is a naive belief in this chaotic age.
ending0307_f line Text05	He looked at you, without a word.
ending0307_f line Text06	
ending0307_f line Text07	Though there is sadness in his eyes, the foot with which he defended others stood their ground.
ending0307_f line Text08	After leaving Xia Pavilion, faced with countless hardships,
ending0307_f line Text09	His silhouette would always appear in your mind.
ending0307_f line Text10	But you shook your head, dispelling that image, refocused, and carried on.
ending0307_f line Text11	You knew, the sooner the Jianghu sees peace,
ending0307_f line Text12	The easier it will be for him to walk his path.
ending0307_f line Text13	Looking at the night sky, on opposite sides of the world, neither of you will stop.
ending0307_f line Text14	You will continue to walk your own path, hoping that the two of you will be walking towards the same end.
